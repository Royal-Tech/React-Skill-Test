As part of this review, the Bureau is seeking comment on the economic impact of the CARD Act Rules on small entities so that it can determine whether the rules should be continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities. Second, the Bureau is conducting a review of the consumer credit card market, within the limits of its existing resources available for reporting purposes, pursuant to the CARD Act, and is seeking comment on a number of aspects of the consumer credit card market.",
